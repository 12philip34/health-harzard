        <p>
            A hazard is a potential source of harm.
            Substances, events, or circumstances can constitute
            hazards when their nature would allow them,
            even just theoretically, to cause damage to health,
            life, property, or any other interest of value.
            The probability of that harm being realized in a
            specific incident, combined with the magnitude of
            potential harm, make up its risk, a term often used
            synonymously in colloquial speech.

        <h2>Health Hazards, Prevention, and Solutions</h2>
        Many homes fall short of the basic requirements of a
        healthy home and contain one or more of hazards that adversely affect human health.

        Scientific research has shown that these housing-related hazards
        pose a broad spectrum of risks, including the following:
       <ol>
           <li>Mold and pests — such as cockroaches, rodents,
               and dust mites — can cause and contribute to asthma,
               allergies, and other respiratory illnesses.
               Since housing conditions can play a significant role in respiratory health,
               these hazards can greatly increase and intensify
               susceptibility to respiratory illnesses.</li>
           <li> Toxic materials such as lead, asbestos, and chemical
               pesticides can harm human health in a variety of ways.
               For instance, lead poisoning in children causes reduced
               IQ and attention span, hyperactivity, impaired growth,
               reading and learning disabilities, hearing loss, insomnia,
               and a range of other health, intellectual, and behavioral problems.</li>
           <li>Poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide and radon also pose
               threats to health. Carbon monoxide poisoning results in more
               than 200 accidental deaths a year and, at much lower levels,
               causes flu-like symptoms, which often go undiagnosed.
               Radon can increase the risk of cancer, which is the second
               leading cause of death among adults and children in the U.S.</li>
       </ol>

        Please refer to the links to the right for more detailed
        information concerning some of the major housing-related
        health hazards, conditions that may result from exposure to them,
        and ways to avoid these hazards.

        The ideal way to maintain healthy homes and properties is to
        practice primary prevention (addressing these hazards before
        they become dangerous problems) using a holistic approach
        (tackling many hazards at once). With this in mind, NCHH has
        included two pages in this section — Moisture and Ventilation
        and Indoor Air Quality — to discuss techniques that can help
        minimize threats from multiple hazards.
        <h1 style="color: green;"> Technical Assistance, Strategic Planning, and Program Evaluation</h1>
        NCHH is a valuable resource to federal, 
        state, and local agencies due to its unique ability to 
        identify and convert credible science, technical expertise,
        and over 20 years of practical experience into accessible and 
        useful information for dissemination, local adaptation, 
        and program growth. NCHH uses this wealth of knowledge and
        skill to provide technical assistance, strategic planning,
        and program evaluation for a variety of program innovation
        and planning tasks. Relevant examples of our work include 
        leading the Grassroots Advocacy Network to develop and test 
        local policies and solutions for healthy housing and developing
        a Healthcare Financing Resource Library, which identifies strategies
        to finance healthy homes services through the healthcare system.
        <h1 style="color: green;">Research and Demonstration</h1>
The National Center for Healthy Housing (NCHH) conducts 
research on key aspects of childhood lead poisoning and 
lead hazard control and reducing exposure to allergens
 and other residential hazards. The results have been used 
 to shape federal and state regulations.

The research agenda at NCHH is organized around these guiding principles:
 <ul>
    <li>
        Discover and/or verify the varied links and interactions between housing and health.
    </li> 
    <li>
        Discover and/or verify housing interventions that support and/or improve health.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide the evidence base for new guidelines, regulatory standards, and legislation.
    </li> 
    <li>Standardize and improve methods of detecting and controlling housing-related health hazards.</li> 
   <li>
    Present findings in varied formats, including but not limited 
    to peer-reviewed scientific literature, conference presentations, and the popular press.
   </li> 
    <li>
        Continue efforts to combat childhood lead 
    poisoning by ensuring policies are practical and scientifically valid.
    </li>
